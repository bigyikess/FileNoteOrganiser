Inspiration:
I wanted an app that can help with sorting through files and notes of any kind. So I made this app which allows for very in depth filtering and sorting to really sort through a entire list of files and notes.

What it does:
Currently, it allows for the user to upload any file from the computer into the app and also allows the user to input whatever note they want. Then the subsequent tabs via the navigation bars take you to a site 
where every thing you uploaded is shown. Then there is a filter bar that helps with the sorting and filtering, you can sort by date, name, ascending, descending and even file type. All file types should by possible
using this app. For the notes page, more or less the same thing but you can also filter by category which is prompted when first imputting. Additionally, you can also remove any entries you want.

How's it built:
It is completely made using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS and DB Browser.

Challenges encountered:
One constant challenge was deciding on how to use the database I created, as every queries is done behind the scenes, correctly constructing the sql query in python and then executing took a lot of trial and error.
Another challenge was the uploading and retrieving the files from the server as this implementation is rather new to me so it took a lot of learning beforehand.

Accomplishments:
One obvious thing is that the app accepts a lot of different file types. Another things would be the sorting system, I thought it was a rather daunting endeavour, but I was able to solve it raher quickly and the 
sorting system works great.

What I learned:
Using a database was so helpful during the creation of the app. Although complex and hard to use, but when done correctly, extremely efficient in storing data and retrieving data. I would definitely use databases in
my future projects. Another thing is how useful the form element in html is, it obviously carried the entire app and can transfer a lot more data that I thought.

Whats Next for FileNoteOrganiser:
When showcasing the project to my friends, they raised the possibility of making the note part leaning more towards note taking rather than organising. I think this is definitely worth expanding on and maybe I will
dedicate time to fully develop a note taking app instead.
